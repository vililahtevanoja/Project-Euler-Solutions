///The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

///
/// The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
/// (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
///
/// Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is

/// Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the
